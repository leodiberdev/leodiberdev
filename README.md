Software Engineer turned SRE. Getting things done by living in the command line.

Right now I'm maily focused on honing my DevOps, Cloud, Network and Infrastructure skills without leaving aside software engineering. I love learning, note taking techniques (mainly zettelkasten) and everything that helps me be more productive. If you want to learn a little more about my journey, check my [blog](https://leotsgo.dev) and my pinned projects below.
